The
body
is the
database
of 
lived 
experience.


Each
gesture
each 
action
leaves
a trace

in the 
cellular
make-up 
of being.

Each 
pulse,
each 
tension
of a
muscle
fiber,
each
hormonal
release,

each
neural
flash,
each
biological

action

and
reaction
leaves 
a
mark, 
an
imprint.


The
colors
of the
rectangles
and
circles
change
in correlation

with my
heart rate
data
collected
on a 
day 
selected

randomly

from 
the first
period of 
quarantine

in 2020.
